# Project-on-Consumer-data-analysis
Hello All, Here is my team work on Consumer analysis for E-commerce platforms.
So we got the data from kaggle website and transformed the data Spark cluster using Apache Pyspark and Spark SQL to get to know proper understanding. We happened to migrate entire spark session from our local machine to cloud platform due to compute problems of our machines, so we used Azure databricks and data lake services to process this big data (52.6 GB)
later on we performed tableau and Power BI data visualizations on the data and obtained some key insights.
